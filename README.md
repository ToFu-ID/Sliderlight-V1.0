# Sliderlight-V1.0
---

ID.3, ID.4, ID.5, and many other vehicles from the VW Group lack slider illumination. With this upgrade, illumination can be retrofitted WITHOUT 
modifying the vehicle's hardware. The circuit activates automatically at dusk and upon detecting movement of the car.

It works with 4 AAA NIMHbatteries (charger included)
